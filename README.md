## Features

### Boxing Mode

Alternates between timed work rounds and rest periods. Designed for classic boxing round training.

- **Built-in presets**: Classic (3×3min), Sparring (5×2min), Rocky (15×3min), Warm-up (6×1min)
- Customizable rounds (1–50), work duration (15s–15min), rest duration (5s–5min)
- 10-second warning sound before the end of each round (plays 2× beep)
- Final 3-second countdown ticks (one beep per second)
- Fixed bell sound scheme

### Tabata Mode

Short, high-intensity intervals following the Tabata protocol.

- **Built-in presets**: Classic (8×20s/10s), Beginner (8×30s/15s), Advanced (10×40s/20s), Endurance (12×20s/10s)
- Customizable rounds (1–30), work (10–120s), rest (5–60s)
- Selectable sound scheme: bell, beep, or whistle
- Last interval highlighted in amber with a 3× warning beep pattern

### Shared Features

- **Countdown timer**: Configurable 5–30 seconds before each workout starts
- **Duration targeting**: Set an approximate workout duration (5–60 min) and rounds are calculated automatically
- **User presets**: Create and save unlimited custom presets per mode (stored locally)
- **Pause / Resume**: Timer pauses with a blinking UI indicator; resume resets the drift reference
- **Stop with confirmation**: Tapping stop triggers a confirmation dialog before ending the workout
- **Haptic feedback**: Light impact on UI interactions, success notification on phase transitions; globally toggleable
- **Keep screen awake**: Screen stays on during active workouts
- **Background audio**: Timer continues running when the phone is locked or the app is backgrounded
- **Recent workouts**: Last 3 workouts shown on the home screen; tap to repeat a configuration
- **Post-workout results screen**: Shows completed rounds, total duration, and any newly unlocked achievements

## Architecture

### State Management

The app uses **Zustand** with four independent stores. Three persist to AsyncStorage; one is in-memory only.

#### 1. Settings Store (`store/settings-store.ts`)

Persists to AsyncStorage key `app_settings`. Loaded on app startup in `_layout.tsx`.

| Field              | Type                            | Default       | Notes                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `language`         | `'uk' \| 'en'`                  | Auto-detected | Device locale; falls back to English |
| `soundScheme`      | `'bell' \| 'beep' \| 'whistle'` | `'bell'`      |                                      |
| `vibrationEnabled` | `boolean`                       | `true`        | Global haptic toggle                 |
| `defaultCountdown` | `number`                        | `5`           | 5–30s, in 5s steps                   |

#### 2. Workout Store (`store/workout-store.ts`)

**In-memory only** — resets when the app closes. Holds the current workout configuration and live timer state.

- Workout config: mode, rounds, work/rest durations, sound scheme, countdown
- Timer state: `phase` (`countdown | work | rest | finished`), `currentRound`, `totalRounds`, `secondsRemaining`, `totalElapsedSeconds`, `isPaused`, `isRunning`
- Active preset ID (for tracking which preset is in use)
- Last session result (for the results screen)
- Config sanitization: all values are validated and clamped before state updates

#### 3. History Store (`store/history-store.ts`)

Persists to AsyncStorage keys `workout_history` and `user_stats`.

- Stores up to **500 workout records** (auto-truncates oldest entries)
- Tracks cumulative stats: total workouts, total rounds, total duration
- Calculates **streak** (consecutive days with at least one workout) using drift-corrected date logic
- Updated after every completed workout

#### 4. Achievement Store (`store/achievement-store.ts`)

Persists to AsyncStorage key `badge_states`.

- Tracks progress and unlock state for all 19 badges
- `checkAndUnlockBadges()` runs after every workout completion
- Coordinates with History Store data for milestone-based badges

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with UI → component calls a store action
2. Store validates and transforms the data → updates state
3. State persisted to AsyncStorage (async, non-blocking) where applicable
4. Components re-render via Zustand hook subscriptions
5. Cross-store coordination: completing a workout triggers Workout Store → History Store → Achievement Store

---

## Timer Engine

The core timer logic lives in `hooks/use-timer.ts`.

### Phase Transitions

```
Countdown (5–30s)
    ↓ onPhaseChange('work')
Work (15s – 15min)
    ↓ onPhaseChange('rest')  OR  onFinish (if last round)
Rest (5s – 5min)
    ↓ onPhaseChange('work') + increment round
    ... repeat until final rest ends → Finished
```

### Timing Mechanism

Uses a **chained setTimeout** approach (not setInterval) with drift correction:

```
expected += 1000
drift = Date.now() - expected
nextDelay = Math.max(0, 1000 - drift)
```

This keeps precision within ±1–3 seconds over long workouts.

### Callbacks

| Callback                                 | Fires when       | Triggers                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `onPhaseChange(phase, round)`            | Phase transition | Sound playback, haptic feedback          |
| `onTick(secondsRemaining, phase, round)` | Every second     | Final 3s tick sounds, 10s boxing warning |
| `onFinish()`                             | Workout complete | Finish sound, stop keep-alive            |

### Background Handling

When the app returns from the background, the timer calculates total elapsed time since it was backgrounded and fast-forwards through any missed phase transitions. Total elapsed time is capped to the planned workout duration to prevent inflation.

### Pause / Resume

- **Pause**: Stops the setTimeout chain, sets `isPaused: true`. UI blinks (opacity 0.3 ↔ 1.0).
- **Resume**: Resets the reference timestamp and restarts the setTimeout chain.

### Example Workout Flow (Boxing: 2 rounds × 1min work, 30s rest, 5s countdown)

```
t=0s   → phase=countdown, seconds=5
t=5s   → phase=work, seconds=60          → bell sound
t=55s  → phase=work, seconds=10          → warning (2× beep)
t=62-64s → phase=work, seconds=3,2,1     → tick sounds
t=65s  → phase=rest, seconds=30, round=1 → bell + haptic
t=95s  → phase=work, seconds=60, round=2 → bell
t=155s → phase=finished                  → finish sound
```

---

## Audio System

Implemented in `hooks/use-sound.ts` and `lib/sounds.ts`.

### Sound Schemes

| Scheme    | Asset                     | Default for |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `bell`    | `assets/sounds/bell1.wav` | Boxing      |
| `beep`    | `assets/sounds/beep1.wav` | Tabata      |
| `whistle` | (uses beep asset)         | —           |

### Sound Events & Patterns

| Event                | When                          | Pattern                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `round`              | Work phase starts             | 1 sound                  |
| `rest`               | Rest phase starts             | 2 sounds (150ms spacing) |
| `warning`            | 10s before round end (boxing) | 2 sounds                 |
| `tick`               | Final 3, 2, 1 seconds         | 1 sound per second       |
| `finish`             | Workout complete              | Finish sound             |
| Tabata last interval | Last work interval starts     | 3 sounds (warning)       |

Sounds are preloaded on app startup (bell and beep assets).

### Background Keep-Alive

A silent audio file (`assets/keepalive/silence.wav`) plays in a continuous loop at 0.01× volume during active workouts. This keeps the iOS audio session alive so the app isn't suspended when locked or backgrounded.

### Platform Audio Configuration

```
iOS:    playsInSilentMode=true, interruptionMode=MixWithOthers
Android: shouldDuckAndroid=false, interruptionMode=DuckOthers
Both:   staysActiveInBackground=true
```

This means workout sounds will **mix over** any playing music on iOS and duck on Android.

| + 4 additional badges | Various milestone conditions      |

Badges are checked after every workout via `checkAndUnlockBadges()` in the Achievement Store.

### Level System (`lib/levels.ts`)

Levels are based on **total rounds completed**:

| Level    | Rounds Required |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Rookie   | 0–49            |
| Amateur  | 50–299          |
| Fighter  | 300–999         |
| Champion | 1,000–4,999     |
| Legend   | 5,000+          |

### Streak Tracking

Streaks count consecutive calendar days with at least one completed workout. The History Store calculates this using date-based logic with drift correction for timezone edge cases.

---

## Localization

The app supports **English** and **Ukrainian** via i18n-js (`lib/i18n.ts`).

- **Auto-detection**: On first launch, the device locale is checked via `expo-localization`. If Ukrainian is detected, `uk` is set; otherwise falls back to `en`.
- **Manual switching**: Users can change language in the Settings tab. The choice persists in the Settings Store.
- **Translation files**: `locales/en.json` and `locales/uk.json` contain all UI strings.
- **User presets**: Saved with bilingual names (both `uk` and `en` fields).

---

## Theme & Design

Defined in `constants/theme.ts`. The app uses a **dark-only** neon aesthetic.

### Color Palette

- Border radii: 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 (pill) px

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI (`npx expo`)
- For iOS testing: Xcode (development build required for background audio)
- For Android testing: Android Studio or a physical device

### Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Use a development build for background-audio testing

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

   Or build one with EAS:

   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

3. Start the dev server for the development build

   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client
   ```

> **Note:** Background timer audio does not work reliably in Expo Go. Use a development build or production build when testing locked-screen or background round bells.

---

## Background Audio Note

The app keeps the audio session alive during workouts with a bundled silent loop at `assets/keepalive/silence.wav`.

If you specifically want the keepalive asset as `assets/sounds/silence.mp3`, generate it manually with:

```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=mono -t 1 -q:a 9 -acodec libmp3lame assets/sounds/silence.mp3
```

Then update the keepalive asset reference in `hooks/use-sound.ts` if you want to switch from WAV to MP3.

---

## Verification Checklist

- Start a workout, lock the phone, and wait for a round transition in a development build.
- Start music in Spotify or Apple Music, then start a workout and confirm bells mix over the music.
- End the workout and confirm the silent keepalive track stops immediately.
